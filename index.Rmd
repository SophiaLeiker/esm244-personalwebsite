## Bio

Master's candidate at UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, focusing on **applied environmental analysis using satellite-based remote sensing data**. 
My goal? To bridge the gap between scientists and those enacting important on-the-ground change across the globe. My interests include: *remote sensing, ecosystem services, nature based solutions, Web3, decentralized finance/crypto/DAOs to fund ecological restoration*.

Collaboration at the nexus of science, policy, and economics is vital to ensure environmental strategies are effectively implemented. Looking forward to the opportunity to continue my growth as a scientist and foster interdisciplinary collaboration. ðŸŒ±
