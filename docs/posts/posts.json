Introduction\nThis report will employ binary logistic regression to test feasibility of using variables plant height (height), canopy length (length), canopy width (width), and number of green leaves (green_lvs) to classify whether a palmetto is species Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia.\nThe analysis will be performed twice, and will use cross validation to compare two models:\nLog odds of plant type using plant height, canopy length, canopy width and green leaves as predictor variable.\nLog odds of plant type using plant height, canopy width and green leaves (i.e., drop canopy length for this model)\nData Source: The data used comes from: Abrahamson, W.G. 2019. Survival, growth and biomass estimates of two dominant palmetto species of south-central Florida from 1981 - 2017, ongoing at 5-year intervals ver 1. Environmental Data Initiative and metadata, including methods used for data collection can be found here EDI Data Portal. The first dataset, palmetto_data, contains survival and growth data across multiple years, habitats and experimental treatments. The second dataset, seedlings_data, follows the fate of marked putative palmetto seedlings in the field to assess survivorship and growth. The final dataset, harvested_palmetto_data, contains size data and estimated dry mass (biomass in grams) of 33 destructively harvested palmetto plants (17 S. repens and 16 S. etonia) of varying sizes and across habitats.\n\n\n# Reading in the data\npalmetto <- read_csv(here(\"_posts\", \"2022-02-18-binary-logistic-regression\", \"data\", \"palmetto.csv\")) %>% \n  clean_names()\n\n\n\n2.

A) Illustrates canopy width as the widest width of the canopy perpendicular to the canopy length 1981-2017 [cm] between the two species, B) Illustrates maximum height 1981-2017 [cm] between the two species. C) Illustrates widest length of the canopy 1981-2017 [cm]. Green leaf spread is analyzed below.The box plots in black indicate the 25th and 75th percentile values of the data spread, the black line indicates the median value.\nTakeaways In general, there seems to be significant overlap in the spread of the width values across the dataset as seen in Figure 1 Part A. Canopy height in Figure 1 Part B illustrates that at the upper and lower ends of the height range, S. repends tends to stand out thus at these points there may be some power in incorporating this variable in analysis. Canopy length has similar trends to canopy width and thus with significant overlap may not provide as much explanatory power in differentiating the two species except at the higher values or when length is around 50cm - 100cm (at these points there seems to be more datapoints for the Serenoa repends (orange))\nVisualizing Variable Relationships (multiple variables)\n\n\nggplot(data = palmetto_clean, aes(x = length, y = width)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Length (cm)\", y = \"Width (cm)\", title = \"Canopy Length and Width for Serenoa repens vs Sabal etonia\", subtitle = \"Data from: Abrahamson, W.G. 2019\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"steelblue1\", \"tan1\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between canopy length and canopy width for Serenoa repend (orange) vs Sabtal etonia (blue).\n\n\nggplot(data = palmetto_clean, aes(x = height, y = green_lvs)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Height (cm)\", y = \"Green Leaves (count)\", title = \"Canopy Height and Green Leaves Count for Serenoa repens vs Sabal etonia\", subtitle = \"Data from: Abrahamson, W.G. 2019\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"steelblue1\", \"tan1\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Relationship between canopy height and green leaves for Serenoa repend (orange) vs Sabtal etonia (blue).\n\n\nggplot(data = palmetto_clean, aes(x = length, y = green_lvs)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Length (cm)\", y = \"Green Leaves (count)\", title = \"Length and Green Leaves Count for Serenoa repens vs Sabal etonia\", subtitle = \"Data from: Abrahamson, W.G. 2019\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"steelblue1\", \"tan1\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Relationship between canopy length and green leaves for Serenoa repend (orange) vs Sabtal etonia (blue).\nOverall Takeaways: The variables that are most likely to help classify species seem to be first and most clearly, the leaf count, followed by height and then length, and lastly width. There seems to be significant overlap in canopy width which indicates that is may not be an ideal candidate to help separate out species. Canopy height and length differ on the upper end of the scale (higher values), but have significant overlap near lower values. Leaf count visually reflects the largest difference between the two species and thus could be the most likely to help classify Serenoa repend vs Sabtal etonia (blue) most clearly.\n3.

Comparing Models using AICc\n\n\nAIC_assessment <- AICcmodavg::aictab(list(species_blr1, species_blr2))\n\n\n\nAICc for Model 1 (plant height, canopy length, canopy width and green leaves) is 5194.57\nAICc for Model 2 (plant height, canopy width and green leaves) is 5987.48\nAccording to this AICc calculation, Model 1 has a lower value for AICc so just based on the AICc, we might anticipate that model 1 will be the better model.\nD. Comparing Model 1 and Model 2 using Ten-fold cross validation\n\n\nset.seed(123) \ntr_ctrl <- trainControl(method = \"repeatedcv\", number = 10, repeats = 10)\n \n# Train the model\n#Formula f1, data frame, method is the generalized linear model\nmodel1_height_length_width_green_lvs <- train(f1, data = palmetto_clean2, \n               method = \"glm\", family = 'binomial',\n               trControl = tr_ctrl)\n#summary(model1_height_length_width_green_lvs)\n#model 1  accuracy 0.9169231  kappa 0.8338335\n \nmodel2_height_width_green_lvs <- train(f2, data = palmetto_clean2, \n               method = \"glm\", family = 'binomial',\n               trControl = tr_ctrl)\n#summary(model2_height_width_green_lvs)\n#model 2   accuracy 0.8988022  kappa 0.7975858\n\n#Since the accuracy of model 1 is higher, we may be able to state that model 1 is the better performing model\n\n\n\nTakeaways : Based on the accuracy results of the corss validation, Model 1 (height, length, width, green_lvs) has a higher accuracy than Model 2 (height, width, green_lvs) and therefore it can be said that model 1 performs better at classification. This aligns with the AICc assessment carried out above.\nFor this reason, Model 1 will be selected to run on the entire dataset.\n4.
