## 1. Introduction
The continuous global loss of biodiversity has driven the development of methodologies for monitoring biodiversity at large spatial scales. Traditional in-situ biodiversity assessments are often spatially limited, with high costs required to gather sufficient data for analysis (Wang and Garmon 2019). Remote sensing provides the opportunity to advance these assessments through the use of rapidly evolving technologies such as high-resolution hyperspectral satellite sensors, airborne laser scanning (LiDAR), and drone assessments (iVihervaara and Auvinen 2017). The use of these tools allows for large area characterization of biodiversity in a “systematic, repeatable, and spatially exhaustive manner” (Duro, Coops and Wulder 2007). With biodiversity loss recognized as a serious threat to human-wellbeing an ecosystem functioning (Vihervaara, et al. 2017), accurate biodiversity monitoring is crucial to include in policy making at the local, national and international levels. Synchronization of remote sensing science and conservation biology is essential for making well informed environmental management decisions (Pettorelli, Wegmann, et al. 2016). With studies estimating that we are losing from 11,000-58,000 species annually (Pettorelli, Wegmann, et al. 2016), there is the need to assess the current state of the to identify and support coordinated efforts to rapidly scale up. This report will assess how remote sensing can be used for biodiversity assessments by 1) outlining the approaches currently used, 2) identifying the limitations of these methods, and 3) briefly discussing opportunities and future directions.

## 2. Approaches Currently Used
Biodiversity is a multifaced concept with many layers of complexity. Due to this, approaches used vary with spatial scale, dimensionality, validation techniques, and use of proxy indicators (Storms and Estes 1993). In general, remote sensing methods to measure biodiversity are broken down into three major categories: a) direct mapping of individual organisms, b) species distribution modeling with habitat mapping as a proxy for biodiversity, c) the use of biodiversity indices/indicators. 
Direct Mapping employs high resolution imagery and machine learning techniques such as digital ocular sampling or image detection and classification to detect species assemblages, or, in some cases, individuals within a population. This analysis can provide valuable information about diversity patters and is most often paired with in-situ field data which can be used for model validation (Turner, et al. 2003). Model success is often driven by data availability and organism characteristics as some species are clearly distinguishable, while others may be more difficult to differentiate from background noise. Studies have shown success in mapping species distribution for terrestrial plant biodiversity using plant functional traits to determine trends in seasonal patterns (Wang and Garmon 2019). Through the use of LiDAR and imaging spectroscopy, this method has also been successful in studying leaf traits and canopy structure as proxies for regional biodiversity (Stein, Katharina and Holger 2014). As plant traits affect light absorption/scattering, this method can be used to distinguish differences in optical properties of plants throughout a landscape by extracting their spectral signatures. 
Species distribution modeling can be used for habitat mapping and predictions of species distribution based on habitat requirements (Nagendra 2010). These maps can be used to provide information on distributions of a large number of species within a variety of habitat types, and overlayed or used for ensemble modeling to carry out biodiversity assessments. These indirect methods often assess habitat heterogeneity as heterogeneity has been regarded “as one of the most important factors governing species richness and has been predicted to have a positive relationship with biodiversity” (Stein, Katharina and Holger 2014). High heterogeneity can provide increased niche spaces for species coexistence, persistence, and diversification (Stein, Katharina and Holger 2014). Habitat mapping can assess climate and habitat structure, geology, and topography, and integrate this information with regional models (such as the National Gap Analysis Program) or local models to estimate biodiversity (Stein, Katharina and Holger 2014). 
Biodiversity indices and aligned algorithms such as the biodiversity variable (Pettorelli, Wegmann, et al. 2016) can be used to standardize biodiversity measures. National biodiversity state indicators such as “Essential Biodiversity Variables” developed and employed by GEO BON (Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network) include 22 candidate variables to be modeled (Vihervaara, et al. 2017). These are model-based integrations of remote sensing & in-situ observations that enable dynamic updates and transparency at low cost. Some of the indicators that can be used to assess and report on progress towards global biodiversity goals and targets include species habitat index, biodiversity habitat index, local biodiversity intactness index, and rate of invasive alien species spread indicator. Vegetation indices can also be employed to assess vegetation community composition and used as proxies for biodiversity (Wang and Garmon 2019). 

## 3. Limitations
With many benefits aligned with remote sensing for biodiversity monitoring, there are also limitations which must be overcome for rapid scaling of standardized approaches. First, while many satellite products freely available, there has been an increasing trend in utilizing private pay-to-view imagery for biodiversity assessments due to their high resolution (Pettorelli, Laurance, et al. 2014). This can prevent replicability and reduce opportunities for coordinated efforts to scale up. Additionally, the requirement of significant in-situ data to validate and test model accuracy can limit overall model confidence. To overcome this, there is a need for increased open data access and data sharing for model training. 
For biodiversity monitoring there are drawbacks to each of the approaches. First, the resolution of satellite data is often too course to pick up individual species, as spectral reflectance is bounded by pixel size (often 30m for Landsat or 10m for Sentinel data). For this reason, these assessments are more beneficial in vegetation assessments with large crown sizes such as canopy cover in forests but are less informative with spatially small organisms (Stein, Katharina and Holger 2014). Direct mapping is applicable over smaller extents, and can be useful for “limited purpose of indicating areas with higher levels of species diversity” (Nagendra 2010), but often, large biodiversity studies lack the resources to obtain and process the immense amount of data that is needed for modeling at a global scale. 
Second, while habitat mapping is good at developing proxy biodiversity assessments, it also has many limitations. First these estimates map potential rather than real species distributions and may not be able to determine rare species abundance which is a key component of understanding biodiversity (Stein, Katharina and Holger 2014). Similar to species mapping, habitat mapping is limited by the resolution of the imagery being used which means that detailed information can be lost when using course resolution satellite products (Stein, Katharina and Holger 2014). 
Third, there is a lack of consistency in the development and implementation of biodiversity variables. Without standards set, biodiversity indices and algorithms are being developed without any coordination, causing overlap and conflicting biodiversity outputs depending on the scale the initial index was developed at. Additionally, there is hesitation in employing biodiversity indicators without understanding the deeper relationships in the landscape, “Links between biodiversity indicators and the pressures affecting them are frequently unclear as links can be obscured by environmental change, data limitations, food web dynamics, or the cumulative effects of multiple pressures” (Gollop, et al. 2019).

## 4. Opportunities/Future Directions
As more satellites are launched increasing both spatial and temporal resolution of earth observation data, there are many avenues to further explore the integrating remote sensing into biodiversity monitoring. 
Based on the limitations due to pixel resolution mentioned above, there is additional work being done on developing approaches for mapping dominant species or vegetation types based on spectral mixture analysis (Dudley, et al. 2015). This approach makes the assumption that a spectral signature is a combination of “end members”, and individual species/relative amounts of species within a mixed pixel can be “identified by applying endmembers that have been obtained from field measures… or simulated radiative transfer models” (Stein, Katharina and Holger 2014). This can provide information to map “indicator species” and support the derivation of biodiversity metrics. Additionally, the integration of LiDAR in these assessments has shown promise. There is currently being work being done to improve assessment of vertical vegetation structures as this is “a key component of habitat quality for many species” (Pettorelli, Laurance, et al. 2014) (Frederic and Hansen 2012).
Finally, large scale assessments are building on an idea that “spectral diversity”/“optical diversity” can be used as proxies for species diversity, functional diversity, and genetic diversity (Stein, Katharina and Holger 2014). This hypothesis is rooted in the theory that combining metrics based on variation in vegetation indices, metrics based on spectral entropy, and metrics based of spectral species can be used to infer biodiversity through an assessment of the mean and variance associated with each (Stein, Katharina and Holger 2014). This connects to work being done to test out the Spectral Variability Hypothesis which postulates that “species richness will be positively related to any objective measure (e.g. standard deviation) of the variation in the spectral characteristics of a remotely sensed image” (Palmer, et al. 1999). The Spectral Variability Hypothesis has been tested with conclusions illustrating that overall performance is dependent on several factors, including “the instrument characteristics (spectral, spatial and temporal resolution), the type of vegetation investigated, and the metrics derived from remotely sensed information to estimate spectral heterogeneity” (Rocchini, Luque and Pettorelli 2018). Even with this variation, studies that employed multispectral high-resolution data (3m) have shown success in using this method (Rocchini, Chiarucci and Loise 2004). 

##5. Conclusions

Capacity building and cross disciplinary collaboration is critical for the success of widespread biodiversity monitoring efforts. There is a dire need to establish more standardized frameworks at a variety of scales, that, with the help of remote sensing, can be applied at any place across the globe. While traditional monitoring methods are still necessary to overcome current methodological limitations, we must expand biodiversity monitoring through remote sensing as a critical tool in our toolbox to preserve ecosystem health across our globe. Whether the approaches used are for direct species identification, habitat modeling, or the development of biodiversity indicators, there much be a joint effort from remote sensing specialists, biologists, and ecologists alike, to expand the limits of where this field can take us.
