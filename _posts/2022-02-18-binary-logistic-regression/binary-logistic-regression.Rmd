## 1. Introduction

This report will employ binary logistic regression to test feasibility of using variables plant height (height), canopy length (length), canopy width (width), and number of green leaves (green_lvs) to classify whether a palmetto is species Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia.

The analysis will be performed twice, and will use cross validation to compare two models:

- Log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy length, canopy width and green leaves as predictor variable.
- Log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy width and green leaves (i.e., drop canopy length for this model)


**Data Source:** The data used comes from: [Abrahamson, W.G. 2019. Survival, growth and biomass estimates of two dominant palmetto species of south-central Florida from 1981 - 2017, ongoing at 5-year intervals ver 1. Environmental Data Initiative](https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/f2f96ec76fbbd4b9db431c79a770c4d5) and metadata, including methods used for data collection can be found here [EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=edi.317.1).
The first dataset, palmetto_data, contains survival and growth data across multiple years, habitats and experimental treatments. The second dataset, seedlings_data, follows the fate of marked putative palmetto seedlings in the field to assess survivorship and growth. The final dataset, harvested_palmetto_data, contains size data and estimated dry mass (biomass in grams) of 33 destructively harvested palmetto plants (17 S. repens and 16 S. etonia) of varying sizes and across habitats.



```{r}
# Reading in the data
palmetto <- read_csv(here("_posts", "2022-02-18-binary-logistic-regression", "data", "palmetto.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```

## 2. Data Exploration and Visualization

- Exploring differences in height, canopy length, canopy width, and green leaves for the two species
- `height` = maximum height 1981-2017 [cm]
- `length` = widest length of the canopy 1981-2017 [cm]
- `width` = widest width of the canopy perpendicular to the canopy length 1981-2017 [cm]
- `green_lvs` = count of green leaves 1981-2017 [dimensionless]
- Assessing what predictor variables might be best used for classification
- `species` column: 1 = Serenoa repens, 2 = Sabal etonia

### A. Cleaning up the data
- Rename to easily identify Serenoa repens to Sabal etonia
- Selecting only the columns of interest 

```{r}
palmetto_clean <- palmetto %>% 
  select("species", "height", "length", "width", "green_lvs")

palmetto_clean$species[palmetto_clean$species == 1] <- "repens"
palmetto_clean$species[palmetto_clean$species == 2] <- "etonia"


```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Evaluating via ggpairs, eval = FALSE after visually assessing trends
palmetto_clean %>% 
  select(species, height:green_lvs) %>% 
  ggpairs(aes(color=species))

#seems like there are differences in green_lvs
#slight difference in height and length
#not much difference in width

```

### B. Visualizing the Data

- Exploring differences in height, canopy length, canopy width, and green leaves for the two species
- Working to determine which predictor variables are more likely to help classify species correctly


```{r}
#Plotting Width
plot1 <- ggplot(data = palmetto_clean, aes(x = species, y = width)) +
  geom_beeswarm(cex = 2, aes(color = species)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Species", y = "Width (cm)", title = "Canopy  Width S. repens, S. etonia", subtitle = "Data from: Abrahamson, W.G. 2019") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Species")) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = NA, width = 0.4, outlier.color = NA) +
    theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
   scale_color_manual(values = c("steelblue1", "tan1")) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.75)) +
    theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill="white", 
                                  size=0, linetype="solid"))

#Plotting Height
plot2 <- ggplot(data = palmetto_clean, aes(x = species, y = height)) +
  geom_beeswarm(cex = 2, aes(color = species)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Species", y = "Canopy Height (cm)", title = "Canopy Height S. repens, S. etonia", subtitle = "Data from: Abrahamson, W.G. 2019") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Species")) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = NA, width = 0.4, outlier.color = NA) +
    theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
   scale_color_manual(values = c("steelblue1", "tan1")) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.80)) +
  theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill="white", 
                                  size=0, linetype="solid"))

#Plotting Length
plot3 <- ggplot(data = palmetto_clean, aes(x = species, y = length)) +
  geom_beeswarm(cex = 2, aes(color = species)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Species", y = "Length (cm)", title = "Canopy Length S. repens, S. etonia", subtitle = "Data from: Abrahamson, W.G. 2019") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Species")) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = NA, width = 0.4, outlier.color = NA) +
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("steelblue1", "tan1")) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.82)) +
  theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill="white", 
                                  size=0, linetype="solid"))
```


#### Visualizing Individual Variables Between Species

- Results from this initial assessment will be used to plot final visualizations comparing variables to eachother by species (see Figures 2,3 and 4 for finalized assessments)
```{r}
plot_grid(plot1, plot2, plot3, labels = c("A.", "B.", "C."), label_size = 20)
```

**Figure 1**: Spread of individual data points for the variables width, height, and length for Serenoa repend (orange) vs Sabtal etonia (blue). A) Illustrates canopy width as the widest width of the canopy perpendicular to the canopy length 1981-2017 [cm] between the two species, B) Illustrates maximum height 1981-2017 [cm] between the two species. C) Illustrates widest length of the canopy 1981-2017 [cm]. Green leaf spread is analyzed below.The box plots in black indicate the 25th and 75th percentile values of the data spread, the black line indicates the median value.

**Takeaways** In general, there seems to be significant overlap in the spread of the `width` values across the dataset as seen in Figure 1 Part A. Canopy `height` in Figure 1 Part B illustrates that at the upper and lower ends of the height range, S. repends tends to stand out thus at these points there may be some power in incorporating this variable in analysis. Canopy `length` has similar trends to canopy `width` and thus with significant overlap may not provide as much explanatory power in differentiating the two species except at the higher values or when length is around 50cm - 100cm (at these points there seems to be more datapoints for the Serenoa repends (orange))


#### Visualizing Variable Relationships (multiple variables)

```{r}
ggplot(data = palmetto_clean, aes(x = length, y = width)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Length (cm)", y = "Width (cm)", title = "Canopy Length and Width for Serenoa repens vs Sabal etonia", subtitle = "Data from: Abrahamson, W.G. 2019") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("steelblue1", "tan1"))
```

**Figure 2**: Relationship between canopy length and canopy width for Serenoa repend (orange) vs Sabtal etonia (blue).

```{r}
ggplot(data = palmetto_clean, aes(x = height, y = green_lvs)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Height (cm)", y = "Green Leaves (count)", title = "Canopy Height and Green Leaves Count for Serenoa repens vs Sabal etonia", subtitle = "Data from: Abrahamson, W.G. 2019") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("steelblue1", "tan1"))

```

**Figure 3**: Relationship between canopy height and green leaves for Serenoa repend (orange) vs Sabtal etonia (blue).

```{r}
ggplot(data = palmetto_clean, aes(x = length, y = green_lvs)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Length (cm)", y = "Green Leaves (count)", title = "Length and Green Leaves Count for Serenoa repens vs Sabal etonia", subtitle = "Data from: Abrahamson, W.G. 2019") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("steelblue1", "tan1"))
```

**Figure 4**: Relationship between canopy length and green leaves for Serenoa repend (orange) vs Sabtal etonia (blue).


**Overall Takeaways**: The variables that are most likely to help classify species seem to be first and most clearly, the `leaf count`, followed by `height` and then `length`, and lastly `width`. There seems to be significant overlap in canopy width which indicates that is may not be an ideal candidate to help separate out species. Canopy height and length differ on the upper end of the scale (higher values), but have significant overlap near lower values. Leaf count visually reflects the largest difference between the two species and thus could be the most likely to help classify Serenoa repend  vs Sabtal etonia (blue) most clearly.

## 3. Binary Logistic Regression

- Converting to factors
- Establishing the factor levels, due to the result below it can be determined that "etonia" will be 0, "repens" will be 1

```{r}
#Converting to factor

palmetto_clean2<- palmetto %>% 
  select("species", "height", "length", "width", "green_lvs") %>% 
  mutate(species = case_when(species == 1 ~ "repens", species == 2 ~ "etonia")) %>% 
  mutate(species = as.factor(species)) %>% 
  drop_na()


levels(palmetto_clean2$species)
```


### A. Log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy length, canopy width and green leaves as predictor variables


```{r}
#establishing the relationships
f1 <- species ~ height + length + width + green_lvs

#Generalized Linear Model

species_blr1 <- glm(formula = f1,
                    data = palmetto_clean2,
                    family = "binomial")
```

Let's look at the results

 - Based on the summary output, all 4 of the variables have low p values which may indicate that they may be significant
 - Interpretation of some coefficients: since green leaves is positive, we could estimate that for every 1.9 additional green leaves it makes it a little more likely that it is a repens.
```{r}
#species_blr1

summary(species_blr1)

blr1_tidy <- broom::tidy(species_blr1)
```

- These are coefficients for the log-linear model (e.g. these are coefficients for the predictor variables that relate to the *log odds* of the "Serenoa repend" outcome).
- It took 7 iterations to reach this model outcome



### B. Log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy width and green leaves

```{r}
f2 <- species ~ height + width + green_lvs

#Generalized Linear Model

species_blr2 <- glm(formula = f2,
                    data = palmetto_clean2,
                    family = "binomial")
```

Let's look at the results

 - Based on the summary output, width and green leaves have low p values which may indicate that they may be significant
 - Height has a higher p values which may indicate it is not as significant for this model
```{r}
#species_blr2

summary(species_blr2)

blr2_tidy <- broom::tidy(species_blr2)
```


```{r}
blr2_fitted <- species_blr2 %>% 
  broom::augment(type.predict = "response")
```


### C. Comparing Models using AICc

```{r}
AIC_assessment <- AICcmodavg::aictab(list(species_blr1, species_blr2))
```

- AICc for **Model 1** (plant height, canopy length, canopy width and green leaves) is `r round(AIC_assessment[1,3],2)`
- AICc for **Model 2** (plant height, canopy width and green leaves) is `r round(AIC_assessment[2,3],2)`

According to this AICc calculation, Model 1 has a lower value for AICc so just based on the AICc, we might anticipate that model 1 will be the better model.

### D. Comparing Model 1 and Model 2 using Ten-fold cross validation

```{r}
set.seed(123) 
tr_ctrl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 10)
 
# Train the model
#Formula f1, data frame, method is the generalized linear model
model1_height_length_width_green_lvs <- train(f1, data = palmetto_clean2, 
               method = "glm", family = 'binomial',
               trControl = tr_ctrl)
#summary(model1_height_length_width_green_lvs)
#model 1  accuracy 0.9169231  kappa 0.8338335
 
model2_height_width_green_lvs <- train(f2, data = palmetto_clean2, 
               method = "glm", family = 'binomial',
               trControl = tr_ctrl)
#summary(model2_height_width_green_lvs)
#model 2   accuracy 0.8988022  kappa 0.7975858

#Since the accuracy of model 1 is higher, we may be able to state that model 1 is the better performing model
```

**Takeaways** : Based on the accuracy results of the corss validation, Model 1 (height, length, width, green_lvs) has a higher accuracy than Model 2 (height, width, green_lvs) and therefore it can be said that model 1 performs better at classification. This aligns with the AICc assessment carried out above. 

For this reason, Model 1 will be selected to run on the entire dataset. 

***

## 4. Running Model 1 (Variables included: `height`, `length`, `width`, `green_lvs`) on entire dataset

```{r}
final_model <- glm(formula = f1,
                    data = palmetto_clean2,
                    family = "binomial")
```


```{r }
final_table <- tidy(final_model) %>% 
  mutate(p.value = case_when(p.value <= 0.0001 ~ "< 0.0001")) %>% 
  rename("Term" = "term")

final_table %>% 
  kbl(digits = 3, caption = "Table 1: Binary Logistic Regression Model Outputs Showing the Variables, Coefficients, Standard Errors", col.names = c("Term", "Estimate", "Standard Error", "Statistic", "P Value")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F)
```

**Final Model Equation**:
`r equatiomatic::extract_eq(final_model, wrap = TRUE, use_coefs = TRUE)`

## 5. Model Evaluation

- Analyzing how successfully this model would “classify” a plant as the correct species, using a 50% cutoff 

```{r}
blr_fitted <- final_model %>% 
  broom::augment(type.predict = "response")

#That shows us the probability (in the `.fitted` column) of the plant being a Serenoa repend on the 4 variables included in this model.
```


```{r}
#creating a function
pred_acc <- function(x, y) {
  accurate <- ifelse(x == y, 1, 0)
  return(accurate)
}

#final_model Serenoa repend (orange) vs Sabtal etonia (blue)
#Adelie will be 0, Chinstrap will be 1)
#"etonia" will be 0, "repens" will be 1

model_success <- palmetto_clean2 %>% 
  mutate(predict_repens = predict(final_model, palmetto_clean2, type = "response")) %>% 
  mutate(predicted = ifelse(predict_repens >= 0.50, "repens", "etonia")) %>%
  mutate(accurate = pred_acc(species, predicted)) %>% 
  mutate(correct =  case_when(species == predicted ~ "Correct",
                              TRUE ~ "Incorrect"))

table2 <- model_success %>%
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(total_accurate = sum(accurate),
            total_inaccurate = n() - sum(accurate),
            model_success = mean(accurate)*100)

table2 %>% 
  kbl(digits = 2, caption = "Table 2: Model Accuracy by Species", col.names = c("Species", "Total Accurate", "Total Inaccurate", "% Correctly Classified")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F)

```

**CONCLUSIONS**: Based on the model success metrics, one can see that on average the model was predicting correctly about 90% of the time. The model was slightly more accurate when predicting Sabtal etonia compared to Serenoa repend, but the difference was only around 2%.
